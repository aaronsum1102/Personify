If you can dream it, you can do it.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
We aim above the mark to hit the mark.
You just can't beat the person who never gives up.
Never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.
keep going!
